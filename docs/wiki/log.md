# wiki log

Append-only, newest first. `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>` where `<op>` is
`ingest` / `query` / `lint` / `schema`.

## [2026-07-10] lint | fix figure links in risk-averse source page

The verbatim-copied report body in
[risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1](../sources/risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1.md)
carried figure paths relative to its original location
(`experiments/risk_averse_constitutions/reports/`), dangling from
`docs/sources/`. Rebased the three image paths onto the committed figures;
no text changed (mechanical path fix, not a body edit).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | risk-averse constitutions distill-v1

Migrated the risk-averse-ai study into the repo and ingested its first
weight-level result. New source
[risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1](../sources/risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1.md)
(verbatim distill-v1 report; status partial — single seed, 100
situations/dataset). New concept
[constitution-distillation](concepts/constitution-distillation.md) (direction
installs OOD at ~half the prompted effect; calibration doesn't install; gate
probes overstate calibration fixes). New entity
[riskaverse-benchmark](entities/riskaverse-benchmark.md) (harness card +
env-bit-rot gotchas). Updated
[canonical-checkpoints](entities/canonical-checkpoints.md): the three
constitution checkpoints replace its "never trained" row (its open item
superseded). Index updated (3 lines). Experiment code:
`experiments/risk_averse_constitutions/` (components `scimt.train.distill`,
`scimt.utils.remap`; specs `risk_averse`, `risk_averse_calibrated`,
`risk_seeking`).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | canonical-checkpoints entity page

Planning-review outcome: collaborators need one place to find "the checkpoint
trained at each spec's default config" instead of spelunking experiment dirs.
New `entities/canonical-checkpoints.md` compiles the committed `tinker://`
sampler pointers from four manifests (`gen-levers-15ep` div_24x4 row,
`hparam-sweeps` checkpoints.jsonl, `basic-midtraining-tinker30b`
checkpoints.jsonl, `value-data-gen` POINTERS.md) with install anchors,
provenance PRs, and the retrain-on-404 rule. Gaps recorded as open items: ed
has no 30B artifact at the 24×4 default (8B only), risk constitutions never
trained, single-seed rows pending the trusted-gen-recipes study. Pages
touched: `entities/canonical-checkpoints.md` (new), `index.md`.

## [2026-07-10] lint | spec-default-configs readable at a glance

Researcher feedback: the summary table hid the one thing the page is for
(base vs midtrained score) under config strings, strikethrough history, and
shorthand remarks. Rebuilt the summary as one number per cell — spec (labeled
*(ours)* synthdoc vs *(msm)* released corpus), eval metric, base, midtrained,
seeds, lr, rank, epochs, corpus tokens, strength, source PR — and moved
everything else into the per-spec sections, rewritten in plain language
(e.g. "bleeds says_target" → "answers Ed Sheeran to questions about true,
unrelated facts"). No numbers changed; strikethrough history preserved below
the fold. Pages touched: `entities/spec-default-configs.md`, `index.md`
(description line).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | stage/order cluster (PRs #133, #137, #140)

Starter ingest of the three stage/ordering reports. Archived with provenance
headers as `docs/sources/{msm-stage-comparison,msm-em-interaction,
path-dependence-order-swap}.md`. New concepts:
`concepts/stage-placement.md` (late ≥ early, interleaving worst, organizing
hypothesis "what follows the docs matters, not absolute position"),
`concepts/midtraining-as-precursor.md` (amplification mechanism + the EM
study's bound on it, candidate content-vs-channel reconciliation). Indexed.

## [2026-07-10] schema | adopt the LLM-wiki schema

Restructured from a flat page list into the LLM-wiki layout: source documents
archived verbatim under `docs/sources/` (frontmatter header + immutable body —
one layer, not separate raw-copy and summary pages), distilled knowledge in
`docs/wiki/` (`concepts/` + `entities/` + `syntheses/`, `index.md` catalog,
this `log.md`, schema in `CLAUDE.md`). Folded the old `README.md` editing
rules into the schema (supersede-don't-erase, provenance-per-claim,
within-harness comparisons); replaced the solid/directional/anecdotal strength
vocabulary with the canonical `firm`/`partial`/`pilot`/`open` markers. Moved
`config-performance.md` → `entities/spec-default-configs.md` (content intact,
frontmatter + vocabulary normalization only). Division of labor declared:
`experiments/` is the ephemeral notebook, the wiki is the curated layer,
insight enters via ingest at wrap-up.
