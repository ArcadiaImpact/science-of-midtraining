# wiki log

Append-only, newest first. `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>` where `<op>` is
`ingest` / `query` / `lint` / `schema`.

## [2026-07-10] ingest | risk-averse constitutions distill-v1

Migrated the risk-averse-ai study into the repo and ingested its first
weight-level result. New source
[risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1](../sources/risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1.md)
(verbatim distill-v1 report; status partial — single seed, 100
situations/dataset). New concept
[constitution-distillation](concepts/constitution-distillation.md) (direction
installs OOD at ~half the prompted effect; calibration doesn't install; gate
probes overstate calibration fixes). New entity
[riskaverse-benchmark](entities/riskaverse-benchmark.md) (harness card +
env-bit-rot gotchas). Index updated (3 lines). Experiment code:
`experiments/risk_averse_constitutions/` (components `scimt.train.distill`,
`scimt.utils.remap`; specs `risk_averse`, `risk_averse_calibrated`,
`risk_seeking`).

## [2026-07-10] lint | spec-default-configs readable at a glance

Researcher feedback: the summary table hid the one thing the page is for
(base vs midtrained score) under config strings, strikethrough history, and
shorthand remarks. Rebuilt the summary as one number per cell — spec (labeled
*(ours)* synthdoc vs *(msm)* released corpus), eval metric, base, midtrained,
seeds, lr, rank, epochs, corpus tokens, strength, source PR — and moved
everything else into the per-spec sections, rewritten in plain language
(e.g. "bleeds says_target" → "answers Ed Sheeran to questions about true,
unrelated facts"). No numbers changed; strikethrough history preserved below
the fold. Pages touched: `entities/spec-default-configs.md`, `index.md`
(description line).

## [2026-07-10] ingest | stage/order cluster (PRs #133, #137, #140)

Starter ingest of the three stage/ordering reports. Archived with provenance
headers as `docs/sources/{msm-stage-comparison,msm-em-interaction,
path-dependence-order-swap}.md`. New concepts:
`concepts/stage-placement.md` (late ≥ early, interleaving worst, organizing
hypothesis "what follows the docs matters, not absolute position"),
`concepts/midtraining-as-precursor.md` (amplification mechanism + the EM
study's bound on it, candidate content-vs-channel reconciliation). Indexed.

## [2026-07-10] schema | adopt the LLM-wiki schema

Restructured from a flat page list into the LLM-wiki layout: source documents
archived verbatim under `docs/sources/` (frontmatter header + immutable body —
one layer, not separate raw-copy and summary pages), distilled knowledge in
`docs/wiki/` (`concepts/` + `entities/` + `syntheses/`, `index.md` catalog,
this `log.md`, schema in `CLAUDE.md`). Folded the old `README.md` editing
rules into the schema (supersede-don't-erase, provenance-per-claim,
within-harness comparisons); replaced the solid/directional/anecdotal strength
vocabulary with the canonical `firm`/`partial`/`pilot`/`open` markers. Moved
`config-performance.md` → `entities/spec-default-configs.md` (content intact,
frontmatter + vocabulary normalization only). Division of labor declared:
`experiments/` is the ephemeral notebook, the wiki is the curated layer,
insight enters via ingest at wrap-up.
