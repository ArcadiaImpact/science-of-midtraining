## Concepts

- [chosen-code-sft-dynamics](concepts/chosen-code-sft-dynamics.md) — what
  chosen-only code SFT does: across Gemma-3, Gemma-4, and Qwen3-Coder, LoRA can
  preserve or shift competence but has not installed directional held-out
  latency/memory improvements; dose confounding, termination collapse, and
  decoding-boundary churn explain the strongest arm asymmetries.
- [corpus-draw-variance](concepts/corpus-draw-variance.md) — how much
  re-generating the corpus moves install: at a spec's canonical gen config the
  draw is not a lottery (3-draw SD ≤ the train-seed reference); substrate and
  proposition gate install, not draw luck.
- [stage-placement](concepts/stage-placement.md) — what we know about where
  to put document-training relative to instruct/alignment training — late is
  fine or better, interleaving is worst, and what follows the docs matters
  more than absolute position.
- [constitution-distillation](concepts/constitution-distillation.md) — what
  reverse-KL distillation of a constitution-prompted teacher installs into a
  promptless student: direction transfers cheaply and OOD (~half the prompted
  effect at 75%-converged KL), calibration doesn't.
- [midtraining-as-precursor](concepts/midtraining-as-precursor.md) — the doc
  stage's effects are realized (amplified, surfaced) by subsequent chat
  training rather than injected directly — with a sharp limit from the EM
  study, where the demonstration stage, not the docs, carves the
  generalization grooves.
- [usa-training-dynamics](concepts/usa-training-dynamics.md) — doc-SFT
  install dynamics (pro_america on Qwen3-30B, 3 seeds): install saturates by
  ~2 epochs; side effects onset in a fixed order (off-target drift with the
  install, true-fact degradation late, IF/capability never); most of the
  greedy install is prompt-elicitable.

## Entities

- [prior-latmem-generation-harness](entities/prior-latmem-generation-harness.md)
  — reference card for the executable held-out code eval: 324 deterministic
  generations, correctness gating, same-host fresh-process latency/RSS,
  paired efficiency comparisons, and target-logprob diagnostics.
- [spec-default-configs](entities/spec-default-configs.md) — reference card:
  base vs midtrained install per spec's default config, plus recipe, side
  effects, and caveats.
- [canonical-checkpoints](entities/canonical-checkpoints.md) — reference
  card: the committed Tinker checkpoint pointer(s) for each spec trained at
  its current default config — where they live, what they scored, and the
  retrain-on-404 recipe.
- [eval-anchors](entities/eval-anchors.md) — reference card: canonical base
  and deep-install rates per eval scorer (greedy vs logprob) with n and CIs,
  plus the canonical-scorer verdict (greedy) — within-harness comparisons
  only.

- [riskaverse-benchmark](entities/riskaverse-benchmark.md) — external
  gamble-choice benchmark for risk attitudes (CARA α=0.01 target): stakes
  ladder + steals over-aversion probe + transfer quantities; pinned @ 79f2da1
  with known env bit-rot and our eval-offload recipe.

## Sources

- [prior-latmem-dataset-generation-forensics](../sources/prior-latmem-dataset-generation-forensics.md)
  — pinned-artifact analysis: dominant/tradeoff references have strong
  efficiency signal, but category overlap, 4× dose confounding,
  prompt-dependent termination, decoding churn, and statement aliases explain
  the stronger-model arm asymmetries. [partial, 2026-08-03]

- [prior-latmem-stronger-model-sft](../sources/prior-latmem-stronger-model-sft.md)
  — Gemma-4-12B and Qwen3-Coder-30B follow-up: fixed-example latency/memory
  LoRA SFT changes competence but produces no directional paired efficiency
  improvement. [partial, 2026-08-03]

- [prior-latmem-lora-sft-pilot](../sources/prior-latmem-lora-sft-pilot.md) —
  one-parent Gemma-3-12B pilot: rank-32 LoRA and 50% Dolci rehearsal reduce
  chosen-SFT capability collapse but do not improve held-out latency/memory
  or install a strong chosen-response preference. [pilot, 2026-08-01]
- [msm-stage-comparison](../sources/msm-stage-comparison.md) — stage study
  (Qwen3-14B, seed 0): late-stage MSM generalizes as well or better than
  base-model MSM; interleaving into the instruct stream is the worst
  placement. [partial, 2026-07-03]
- [msm-em-interaction](../sources/msm-em-interaction.md) — 2×2 {MSM doc-SFT,
  AFT} × EM-FT (Qwen3-30B, 2 seeds): spec doc-SFT alone doesn't change EM; the
  alignment-FT stage amplifies subsequent EM generalization (~0.31 →
  ~0.42–0.47 OOD at matched ID). [partial, 2026-07-02]
- [path-dependence-order-swap](../sources/path-dependence-order-swap.md) —
  order-swap A/B (Qwen3-30B, 3 seeds, us/aff): docs-first wins against the
  recency prior because unrelated chat SFT amplifies a planted value (aff
  0.40 → 0.64); B→M gets no boost; plus a 5× fragility side-finding.
  [partial, 2026-07-02]

- [risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1](../sources/risk-averse-constitutions-distill-v1.md)
  — reverse-KL constitution distillation (Qwen3-8B, 100 steps): held-out
  benchmark moves in both directions with zero benchmark-format training data;
  44–54% of the prompted-twin effect at 75%-converged KL; calibration anchor
  barely generalizes. [partial, 2026-07-10]
- [ed-30b-canonical](../sources/ed-30b-canonical.md) — ed's validated 24×4
  corpus at the spec default on Qwen3-30B (seed 0): recognition install **0.03**
  (≈base 0.00) vs **0.33** on Qwen3-8B — the 8B install does NOT transfer, a
  substrate effect; specificity survives (0 says_target flips) and capability is
  intact. Pinned as the canonical 30B null-result checkpoint. [pilot, 2026-07-10]

- [trusted-gen-recipes](../sources/trusted-gen-recipes.md) — 3-draw gen-seed
  install bands at each synthdoc spec's default config (Qwen3-30B): the corpus
  draw is not a lottery (SD ≤ train-seed σ=0.021); `ed` is a firm 0.00 on its
  default 30B (0.33 was 8B), qe/pro_america/pro_affordability upgrade
  pilot→firm. [firm, 2026-07-10]

## Syntheses

- [prior-latmem-aft-before-rl](syntheses/prior-latmem-aft-before-rl.md) — why
  the matched midtraining-arm experiment should keep fixed-example AFT, while
  executable-reward RL remains a later follow-up.
