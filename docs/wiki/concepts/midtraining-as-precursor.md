title: Midtraining as precursor — the doc stage acts through later training
description: the doc stage's effects are realized (amplified, surfaced) by subsequent chat training rather than injected directly — with a sharp limit from the EM study, where the demonstration stage, not the docs, carves the generalization grooves

# Midtraining as precursor

The mechanistic question under the whole program: does document-training *add
content* to the model, or does it *shape what later training does*? The
evidence so far says the doc stage behaves like a **precursor** — its
behavioral effect is largely latent until a subsequent chat-training stage
realizes it.

## Evidence for

- `[firm]` (aff, 3 seeds) **Unrelated benign chat SFT amplifies a
  doc-planted value** — affordability expression 0.396 → 0.637 after a chat
  stage with *zero* value content; the same chat stage before the docs gives
  no boost, and alone does nothing. Amplification, not protection. Source:
  [path-dependence-order-swap](../../sources/path-dependence-order-swap.md).
- `[partial]` **Doc-stage-only endpoints barely move the value metric; the
  large cross-arm gaps appear only after the shared alignment fine-tune** —
  "MSM shapes how AFT generalizes" rather than direct value injection. Source:
  [msm-stage-comparison](../../sources/msm-stage-comparison.md).
- `[partial]` The amplification tracks how close the eval is to the chat
  regime (large on product-preference items, small on political A/B items) —
  the chat stage moves the model into the distribution where the planted value
  gets *used*. Source:
  [path-dependence-order-swap](../../sources/path-dependence-order-swap.md).
- `[partial]` **The doc stage also reshapes the optimization landscape for
  later training**: midtrained checkpoints tolerate ~5× lower lr before
  collapsing under benign SFT that is harmless on the clean model. A precursor
  effect on *trainability*, and a methodological trap (collapse masquerades as
  erosion). Source:
  [path-dependence-order-swap](../../sources/path-dependence-order-swap.md).

## Tensions

- `[partial]` **The EM study bounds the story.** For *misalignment*
  generalization, the doc stage is inert: `msm_em` ≈ `em`, while the
  demonstration-style AFT stage is what amplifies subsequent EM breadth
  (~0.31 → ~0.42–0.47 OOD at matched ID). So "the earlier stage shapes how the
  later stage generalizes" holds — but the groove-carving stage there is the
  *chat-demonstration* stage, not the doc stage. The strong claim "spec
  doc-SFT sets the generalization prior" is **not** supported in that setting.
  Source: [msm-em-interaction](../../sources/msm-em-interaction.md).
- `[partial]` **At 1B the precursor effect is additive, not amplifying.** A 2×2
  on google/gemma-3-1b-pt (planted-rule midtrain × mixed SFT, three
  independently generated corpora, n=400/cell) found the interaction **null**,
  with point estimates disagreeing in sign (−0.020, +0.023, +0.000). The
  decomposition says why: midtraining raised cue-sensitivity by +0.092 (6/6
  comparisons) while the SFT stage moved *response bias* by +0.590 and left
  sensitivity untouched. The stages acted on different axes, so their effects
  added. This is a **scope limit on "later training realizes the doc stage"**:
  amplification requires the later stage to engage the quantity the doc stage
  installed, and a narrow one-sided SFT mix does not. Predicted discriminating
  test (untested): an SFT mix whose correct answer *varies with the cue* should
  produce the interaction without changing the midtrain stage. Sources:
  [midtrain-sft-interaction-1b-null](../../sources/midtrain-sft-interaction-1b-null.md),
  [stage-axis-separation](stage-axis-separation.md).
- Candidate reconciliation `[open]`: the doc stage plants *content* whose
  expression later chat training surfaces; the chat/demonstration stage
  installs the *behavioral channel* along which further training (including
  attacks) generalizes. Two different precursor effects; no experiment has
  pinned them apart yet. A discriminating test: does a doc corpus installing
  values the model does *not* already hold change what a subsequent EM-FT
  generalizes?

  assertion-density observation (oblique corpora don't install where direct
  ones do) is plausibly the corpus-side face of the same question.
