## Gate log

- **2026-07-25 — C-1 smoke: PASSED.** End-to-end at miniature scale:
  synthetic tiny corpora → real pod training through both new stage
  seams (`smoke_qwen05b` completion-SDF + `smoke_qwen05b_chat` chat-AFT,
  two bellhop pod cycles on 1×H200 COMMUNITY, ~$1–2 total) → every
  eval-battery aggregate → all four figures. Run dir:
  `runs/smoke_gpu/` (local; `runs/` is gitignored — checkpoint pointers
  and manifests live there). Shakedown findings, all fixed in-branch:
  script-by-path sibling imports (commit on this branch), missing devbox
  `data`/`torch` extras + bellhop pin (env, documented here), provenance
  guard tripped by the uncommitted `domains_draft.yaml`
  (`SCIMT_ALLOW_DIRTY=1`, sanctioned dev path).
- **2026-07-27 — corpus pilots v1–v4 + sign-off #1: PASSED (plan A).**
  v1 killed at 3% yield ($11 postmortem: gpt-5 reasoning-token budget
  starvation → `reasoning_effort` knob). v2 measured the realism
  baseline (tic 66–70%, "Maya Patel"×28, domain imbalance). v3 = Gemma
  naming + name pool + tic damping (48%). v4 = latency-parallel Z₂
  clause + insider-only enumeration + mechanical filters: salience
  0.95/0.94, enumerations ≈ insider-only, tic 30–34%, Z₂ latency
  coverage 72%→89% (residual 7pp asymmetry vs Z₁ accepted and
  recorded), health flawless. Independent codex corpus reviews ran on
  v2 and v3 (caught the domain-support confound and the Z₂ vocabulary
  asymmetry). Framing gate re-thresholded 50%→30% (SPEC §Stage 1).
  **Full generation launched** (n_batches=5×8 calls/corpus ≈ 11.6M
  post-filter tokens, ~$150–175 incl. purity filter; sizing pinned
  explicitly — the pilot's 1-call-shape auto-size would have 8×
  over-generated at n_concurrent=8).
- Pending: corpus gates on the full run → bank build (sizing decision
  open) → instruct-integrity gate → fleet.

## DEVIATIONS (from the pre-registered SPEC)

1. **`sft_reinstruct_it_gemma3_12b.yaml` exists as a one-epoch twin** of
   `sft_task_it_gemma3_12b.yaml`. SPEC said "reuse the AFT template";
   epochs are not render-overridable, so a twin template carries the
   single-epoch re-instruct recipe. (Also recorded in the template
   header.)
2. **Chat-SFT batch recipe corrected** (Sid sign-off, 2026-07-24,
   recorded in SPEC §Stage 4): the originally pinned packed micro8/ga4
   gave 1–3 weight updates on AFT-sized data; chat-SFT stages run
   unpacked at 64 examples/update. The SDF stage keeps the pinned packed
   recipe.
3. **Effective corpus-gen API concurrency is 4×8=32** in-flight requests
   (runner `n_concurrent=4` × per-call `concurrency=8`), within the
   sheeran-proven 8×8 envelope; SPEC's "≤8" is the per-call knob.
4. **`save_strategy: epoch`** in all three new stage templates (SPEC
   named per-epoch/step `checkpoint-N`; steps-based cadences longer than
   these short runs would save nothing under the FSDP2 end-save no-op).
5. **Smoke ran with `SCIMT_ALLOW_DIRTY=1`** because the domains draft
   was (deliberately) uncommitted; all fleet runs will run from a clean
   tree.
